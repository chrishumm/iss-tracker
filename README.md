# ISS-Tracker

This is a GUI application written in Python that tracks the ISS above the Earth.
I connect to the ISS real time using APIs and draw the position over an image drawn in Python Turtle package.

It also displays the current astronauts on board the ISS, along with the vessel. 

# Features

- Real-time tracking of the ISS
- Shows current astronauts aboard the ISS

# TODO

As an alpha game, the following features are being worked on and implemented:
- Add different satellites.
